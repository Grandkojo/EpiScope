# Health Dashboard Analytics Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully created a comprehensive analytics system for the Health Dashboard that provides data-driven insights, time series forecasting, and AI-powered analysis. The implementation includes three main components:

1. **Analytics Data APIs** - For dashboard statistics and data visualization
2. **Time Series Forecasting APIs** - For 3, 6, 9, and 12-month predictions

**Data Sources**:
- `src/artifacts/time_series/health_data_eams_diabetes_time_stamped.csv`
- `src/artifacts/time_series/health_data_eams_malaria_time_stamped.csv`

**Forecasting Methods**:
- Linear regression for trend analysis
- Seasonal decomposition for seasonal patterns
- Statistical confidence intervals

**API Endpoints Created**:
- `GET /api/forecast/` - Basic time series forecast
- `GET /api/forecast/multi-locality/` - Multi-locality forecasts
- `GET /api/forecast/seasonal/` - Seasonal forecasts
- `GET /api/forecast/accuracy/` - Forecast accuracy metrics

### 3. AI Insights Service (`api/services/ai_insights.py`)

**Purpose**: Provides AI-powered insights using Gemini

**Key Features**:
- General insights about health data
- Trend analysis insights
- Anomaly detection
- Prediction insights
- Correlation analysis
- Natural language Q&A about health data
- Statistical anomaly detection

**AI Integration**:
- Gemini API integration for intelligent analysis
- Fallback mock responses when API key is not configured
- Context-aware Q&A system

**API Endpoints Created**:
- `GET /api/ai/insights/` - AI-powered insights
- `POST /api/ai/qa/` - AI Q&A responses
- `GET /api/ai/anomalies/` - Anomaly detection

### 4. API Views and URLs

**Updated Files**:
- `api/views.py` - Added 15 new API views
- `api/urls.py` - Added 15 new URL patterns
- `requirements.txt` - Added `requests` dependency

**New API Views**:
- Analytics dashboard views (8 endpoints)
- Time series forecasting views (4 endpoints)
- AI insights views (3 endpoints)

### 5. Documentation

**Created Files**:
- `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Comprehensive API documentation
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Data Flow and Architecture

```

- **Time Range Filters**: 3M, 6M, 12M, 2Y, Custom Range
- **Display Options**: Overlay, Side-by-Side, Forecast
- **Disease Statistics**: Incidence, mortality, descriptions

### 2. Disease Trend Analysis
- **Time Series Charts**: Historical data visualization
- **Forecasting**: 3, 6, 9, 12-month predictions
- **Confidence Intervals**: Uncertainty quantification
- **Multi-locality Support**: Compare trends across localities

### 3. AI Insights Section
- **Intelligent Analysis**: AI-powered insights about health data
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns
- **Natural Language Q&A**: Ask questions about the data
- **Predictive Insights**: Future trend predictions

### 4. Data Visualization Support
- **Principal Diagnoses**: Top diagnosis codes with counts
- **Additional Diagnoses**: Secondary diagnosis analysis
- **NHIA Status**: Insurance coverage statistics
- **Pregnancy Status**: Maternal health data
- **Hotspots**: Geographic disease clustering
- **Age/Sex Distribution**: Demographic analysis

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
```bash
# For AI insights (optional)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### Dependencies Added
- `requests` - For Gemini API integration
- `scikit-learn` - For time series forecasting
- `pandas` - For data processing
- `numpy` - For numerical computations

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Integration
```javascript
// Get dashboard overview
const overview = await fetch('/api/analytics/overview/');

// Get 6-month forecast
const forecast = await fetch('/api/forecast/?disease=diabetes&months=6');

// Get AI insights
const insights = await fetch('/api/ai/insights/?type=trends');

// Ask AI questions
const qa = await fetch('/api/ai/qa/', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    question: "What is the trend in diabetes cases?"
  })
});
```
